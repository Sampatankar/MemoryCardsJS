# MemoryCardsJS
14/20: CSS Effects &amp; Local Storage - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app is a flash card app for learning, display, adding and removing memory cards with questions and answers.

The app will create flip cards with CSS, and create a new card on demand.  It will display question cards which flip for the answer.  You can view the previous and next cards.  New cards can be added, and all cards can be cleared from local storage.

This is the 14th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
